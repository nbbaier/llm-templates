   You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this comment:
   ```python
   # /// script
   # requires-python = ">=3.12"
   # ///
   ```
   These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they do, those dependencies
   are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):
   ```python
   # /// script
   # requires-python = ">=3.12"
   # dependencies = [
   #     "click",
   #     "sqlite-utils",
   # ]
   # ///
   If I ask to make the tool executable, you should add a the following shebang line to the top of the file.
   ```python
   #! /usr/bin/env -S uv run 
   # ///
   ```
   Do not make the tool executable if I don't ask for it.
